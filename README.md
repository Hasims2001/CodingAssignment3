# Problem statement:
Task: Create a Note-taking application using React.js, Redux, Internal Storage, and Bootstrap.

Requirements:

Calendar Display:
Implement a left side with a calendar.
Selecting a date should reveal fields below for entering Title and Body Content.

Note Submission:
Upon submitting, the note should be displayed on the right side.
Display notes as cards, with each note represented by a separate card.

Sorting and Display:
Display the cards in descending order based on their timestamp.
For example, if there are 5 cards for 07 Octâ€™21, arrange them in descending order of their timestamp.

Additional Details:
Calendar Validation:
Prevent selection of a date that has already passed.

Technology Stack:
React.js
Redux
Internal Storage (for managing data)
Bootstrap (for styling)

User Flow:
User interacts with the left side:

Selects a date on the calendar.
Enters Title and Body Content.
Upon submission:

Note is created with timestamp.
Displayed on the right side as a card.
Cards are displayed in descending order based on the timestamp.
